This post will walk you through your first purchase of shares in the stock market.

### Prerequisites

- Have $100-$250 in a bank account.
- Feel comfortable spending $100-$250 to learn what "trading in the stock market" means.

### Such Motivation

Let's learn about the STOCK MARKET.  Stocks, or shares, are not investments.
Shares are intangible numbers in computers, and have very little intrinsic utility, just like checks, coupons, or lottery tickets.
But we freely change cash for shares with the belief that the shares can be traded back at a more favorable price.

Note: A company does NOT get money when you buy a share of their stock. Companies get money from investment banks in exchange for
"shares": contracts which give the holder some nominal "vote" on how to run the company (in reality, only deep-pocketed funds have significant voting control).
Investment banks act as wholesalers and resell the shares on a public exchange, a.k.a. the secondary market.

Why do we buy shares then?
 - We take a calculated risk that REAL financial investments, like corporate bonds, or dividend-bearing shares, are .
 

##### Define: Investment
Investing is a way of spending money for future production. 
- For example, if you have a bakery, you might invest in a new commercial oven.

##### Define: Speculation
Speculation is a way of spending money for future price gains. 
- For example, if your friend thinks your bakery is doing great, she might speculate on the real estate in the neighborhood.


So what will we be doing?

1. Trading stocks can be like choosing a bank to hold some of your savings, 
2. **OR** it can be like speculating on real estate, flipping them for a profit.

By trading in the stock market, you should be aware that you are doing one (or both) of these two things.

**You should choose: are you a saver, or a speculator?**

[] Saver
[] Speculator
[] Both


### Opening a Brokerage Account

A *Brokerage Account* is like a bank account.  In fact, most banks have brokerages and can open
a brokerage account if you ask, but you have better options out there. 

Examples, circa 2017:

#### Brokerage

Beyond eTrade, Fidelity, and CharlesSchwab, there are some more competitive brokers:

- [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/): a finance-tech startup, trade via mobile-app; perk: charges $0 commission 
- [Merrill Edge](www.merrilledge.com): an online brokerage from a big bank, Bank of America, perk: offers signup cash-back bonus
- [Interactive Brokers](www.interactivebrokers.com): an online brokerage that routinely garners top rankings; perk: advanced / professional features 

#### Passive Investments, Asset Management

Special note: the "savers" demographic has recently garnered the attention of new, upstart "passive" asset managers. 
Typically, they have mobile-friendly apps, and you simply choose from a menu of style, sector, or risk tolerances. The asset manager will do the actual buying and selling.
Here are just a few:

- [Wealthfront](https://wealthfront.com)
- [Betterment](https://betterment.com)
- [Stash](https://stashinvest.com)
- [Acorns](https://acorns.com)
 
##### What to Expect

Typically, you don't pay any fees to open or maintain a brokerage account. However, you
will likely be charged "commission" and "transaction" fees whenever you put in an order.

Opening a brokerage account is similar to opening a bank account, with minor differences: 

There is a survey of your trading experience level.  
Your answers to this survey will determine the "risk" that the broker associates 
with your account, and will affect the permissions they will grant to your account (like options trading).
Don't think too hard about your answers: you can retake the survey later.

There are lots of "add-on" features like margin, depth-of-book prices, and research notes.
Don't think too hard here either: decline; they will be happy to take your money later.

Once your brokerage account is active, you'll need to deposit money into it.  Typically,
an electronic deposit suffices. The deposit should take a couple business days.

### Going Shopping

Now, to choose a stock.  For this, you'll need to know: are you a Saver or a Speculator? 

#### Savers (Speculators, you can skip this)
If you are a saver, you have 
[lots](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661)
[of](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing)
[people](www.suzeorman.com)
telling you what to do already. They are enlightened people, and mostly they are very helpful.

That said, their main objective is to dissuade you from taking risks you don't understand. They are not trying to
educate you on placing orders or choosing stocks.  Speculating in this way is equivalent to visiting your bank's local branch on pay day.
The primary question is HOW MUCH money to risk, not WHICH SPECIFIC stocks to choose.

In fact, this is exactly how 401k contributions are made.

So, a good starting "stock" for savers will not be a stock at all, but a security called an *Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF)*.

##### Example Stocks for Savers
 - [VTI](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/vti/quote.html) : Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (like literally buying a bit of every public US company)
 - [SPY](http://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/spy/quote.html) : SPDR S&P 500 ETF (like buying the 500 companies that [Standard & Poor's](https://www.standardandpoors.com) likes)
 - [KO](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/ko/quote.html) : Coca-Cola
 - [JNJ](http://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xnys/jnj/quote.html) : Johnson & Johnson (consumer packaged goods)

#### Speculators (Savers, you want to skip this)
If you are a speculator, there are 
[lots](https://www.collective2.com) 
[of](https://www.tradingview.com/ideas) 
[people](http://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/)
telling you what they did, and how much money they've made doing it.  It can be a bit unsavory, downright annoying, 
and most of it probably doesn't help you at all. 

That said, speculators illuminate the vast array of assets available to trade, and challenge common beliefs about those assets. A complete beginner in the stock market
has access to:
- or short-sell the Japanese Yen, 
- or receive 12% annual dividends, 
- or magnify 3x the percent-change of the S&P 500 every single day. 

Speculation at this scale is the reason statistics was created, literally.

There are no typical starting stocks, but here are the real-life ticker symbols that demonstrate the characteristics described above:

##### Example Stocks for Speculators
 - [UPRO](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPRO) : Triple S&P500 ETF (if S&P500 is up/down 1%, this is up/down 3%)
 - [SH](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SH) : Inverse S&P500 ETF (if the market goes up 1%, this goes down 1%)
 - [PSEC](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSEC) : Prospect Capital, a business development company that yields ~12% in dividends as of Jan 2017.
 - [FXY](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXY) : Japanese Yen vs US dollar (if Â¥ per $ goes up, this goes down)
 - If you already have a company in mind, go ahead and find its trading symbol!

### Checkout: Your First Order
 
With $250, you can buy at least one share of most of the stocks listed above, and have some remainder in cash.

#### When

Enter your order whenever you want, but regular trading hours are 9:30am - 4:00pm EST (Wall Street time).

Some brokerages will execute orders *outside regular trading hours*, but you must explicitly grant / have permission, and those hours
are inherently limited and thus, risky: very few trades occur before 8:00am or after 6:00pm.

We should stick to regular-hours trading, because there are more market participants that will compete to *fill* your order. More competition means a better price.

#### How

Pull up the order screen on whatever website or app your broker provides.

Typically you will have three main inputs:
 - Type of "Buy" orders:
   - Market (Market-Priced) Order (i.e. just take the closest price at this time)
   - Limit Order (set a maximum price to pay)
 - Quantity
 - Price

 You should almost never use Market Orders, since it's like buying something without asking the price. 

Choose "Limit" order, then enter both a quantity and price.  If you want your order to actually be filled, you'll need to set a reasonable price
that is **near or above** the latest quoted price (as seen on your broker's quote system, or Google's or Yahoo's finance sites).

Then ((quantity * price) + commissions + fees) can't be more than the cash value in your account.  Your broker will tell you if you've over-reached.
 
#### Where

You usually have no say in where your order goes. Your broker will choose to match your order with other orders that they already know about, or
your broker will send it off to a myriad of exchanges in some order and combination, subject to their own internal business rules (not always for your benefit).

Sometimes though, you can specify an exchange that might have lower transaction fees.

#### Waiting for Fill

If you set a limit price above the prevailing market quote, you are being generous to the sellers, and your order should fill immediately. 

If you set a limit price below the market quote, it may never fill (and since most orders are "day" orders, it will expire at the end of the trading day).

Feel free to edit or cancel existing orders as much as necessary to get it to fill, but be forewarned: you may be charged fees for cancelled orders. (Check with your broker.)

### Congratulations, Adult
Once your order fills - congratulations!  You are now a stock market participant!

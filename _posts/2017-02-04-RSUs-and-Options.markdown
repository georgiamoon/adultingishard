Here's a checklist of things you should do before and after you receive equity as compensation.

### What the What?

You might have the option to receive different kinds of equity:

- An *RSU* is a *Restricted Stock Unit*, a.k.a. share of stock. Typically, these are granted on a vesting 
schedule, typically 4 or 5 years until you are officially the owner of all the RSUs granted.  

- An *option* is a contract to sell you shares at a given price. Similar to RSUs, these are granted on
a vesting schedule, but they also have an expiration date, after which their value falls to $0. So, you
will want to *exercise* your option, but only if it has a positive value (current share price > option
 strike price). 

Generally, RSUs are simpler to understand and to account for when filing taxes.

### Taxes

The only reason to worry about people giving you free stuff is **TAXES**.

With RSUs, it's relatively simple: the amount vested each year counts as income, just like your salary.

With options, you can really stumble:
 - ISO (incentive) or NSO (nonqualified)? 
 - Picking an Exercise Date (Holding Period for Option)
 - Knowing fair-market value on Exercise Date

### "Before" Checklist

The goal of this checklist is to gather information for planning your "exit" and potential annual taxes.

 1. Ask for the vesting schedule: does it have vesting front-loaded or back-loaded

 2. Ask for the last 409A valuation of your company
 
 3. If options, ask for the terms: ISO or NSO, expiration date, and strike price of the options 
 (they SHOULD be the same as the 409A share price)

With these answers (and your own assumptions on valuation growth), you should be able to do some 
back-of-the-envelope math and figure out how much paper-profit you might make with each vested unit.

### "After" Checklist

The goal of this is to smooth your income as much as possible. This minimizes taxes. *N.B.* You probably want a spreadsheet to go along with this. 

 1. Do you still believe the newly-vested options / RSUs will increase in price?
 
 2. Will you have significant one-time incomes this year?
